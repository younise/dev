&lt;p>&lt;span data-preserver-spaces="true">The general availability (GA) for the next evolution of Azure VMware Solution (AVS) was announced &lt;del>yesterday&lt;/del> during the &lt;a href="https://news.microsoft.com/ignite-2020-book-of-news/#158-next-generation-azure-vmware-solution-now-generally-available">Microsoft Ignite 2020&lt;/a> virtual conference. This is a joint partnership between Microsoft and VMware, where Azure VMware Solution is a Microsoft managed service built on Azure bare metal infrastructure and cloud verified by VMware. The initial launch of the Azure VMware Solution in May of 2019 was by CloudSimple; this latest release is built and architected by Microsoft, providing an integrated experience with Azure services. Azure VMware Solution is currently available in the following 10 regions: East US, North Central US, West US, UK South, Japan East, West Europe, North Europe, Canada Central, Australia East, and Southeast Asia. More regions will be available in the future; additional details can be found by searching the &lt;/span>&lt;a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/global-infrastructure/services/?products=azure-vmware&amp;amp;regions=all">&lt;span data-preserver-spaces="true">Microsoft Products available by region page&lt;/span>&lt;/a>&lt;span data-preserver-spaces="true">.

Google Cloud VMware Engine is &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/hybrid-cloud/google-cloud-vmware-engine-is-generally-available">now generally available&lt;/a> to all starting in US-east and US-west regions with plans to add eight more regions by the end of the year. When deployed, customers will receive a GCVE private cloud, which consists of ESXi Hosts, vCenter Server, vSAN, and NSX-T running on Google Cloud bare metal. Also included is VMware HCX, which allows customers to extend and migrate workloads from on-premises to GCVE and between GCVE private clouds.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Uniquely Identifying Virtual Machines In VMware HCX</title><link>https://emadyounis.com/dev/blog/2020-03-17-uniquely-identifying-virtual-machines-in-vmware-hcx/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Mar 2020 08:12:40 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://emadyounis.com/dev/blog/2020-03-17-uniquely-identifying-virtual-machines-in-vmware-hcx/</guid><description>&lt;p>I’ve received several questions lately on what happens to a VM’s Managed Object Reference (MoRef) ID and InstanceUUID when it’s migrated across different vCenter Servers using VMware HCX.

This means all the required vCenter Server services are running on the same node. The release of &lt;a href="http://emadyounis.com/whats-new-in-vcenter-server-6-7-update-1/">vSphere 6.7 Update 1 introduces the convergence CLI tool&lt;/a>. Customers with an existing external deployment can now change their topology to embedded. This deployment model also supports Enhanced Linked Mode (ELM). In the past, an external Platform Services Controller (PSC) was only needed for ELM. This is no longer the case with a simplified deployment model. While we are on the subject, let me clear up a few misconceptions I’ve seen about embedded deployments.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>What&amp;#8217;s New in vCenter Server 6.7 Update 1</title><link>https://emadyounis.com/dev/blog/2018-10-16-whats-new-in-vcenter-server-6-7-update-1/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Oct 2018 13:18:55 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://emadyounis.com/dev/blog/2018-10-16-whats-new-in-vcenter-server-6-7-update-1/</guid><description>&lt;p>Today I’m happy to announce &lt;a href="https://my.vmware.com/en/web/vmware/info/slug/datacenter_cloud_infrastructure/vmware_vsphere/6_7">vSphere 6.7 Update 1&lt;/a> is now generally available. This release includes a single vSphere Client to manage them all. I’m referring to the HTML5 based vSphere Client, now fully featured. Also, included in this release are the necessary tools for convergence and repointing. An external Platform Services Controller (PSC) for enhanced linked mode is a thing of the past. Customers can now convert to a simplified embedded deployment supporting the same functionality.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Learning Hybrid Cloud Extension (HCX) Part 2: Migration Types</title><link>https://emadyounis.com/dev/blog/2018-10-08-learning-hybrid-cloud-extension-hcx-part-2-migration-types/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Oct 2018 12:50:03 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://emadyounis.com/dev/blog/2018-10-08-learning-hybrid-cloud-extension-hcx-part-2-migration-types/</guid><description>&lt;p>I recently attended a cloud migration session. The first thing the speaker said was “we want you to migrate to the Cloud, but we don’t care how you do it”. There was no discussion of service level agreements (SLA), dependencies, or migration options, only get to the cloud! Before migrating any workload, it’s important to have a good understanding of its SLAs, dependencies, and data. Once you have a good grasp of the workload, the next step is selecting the right migration tool or type. The following is in no particular order, but here are a few things to consider before starting a migration:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Learning Hybrid Cloud Extension (HCX) Part 1: Overview</title><link>https://emadyounis.com/dev/blog/2018-09-19-learning-hybrid-cloud-extension-hcx-part-1-overview/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Sep 2018 15:02:04 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://emadyounis.com/dev/blog/2018-09-19-learning-hybrid-cloud-extension-hcx-part-1-overview/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://hcx.vmware.com/#/home">Hybrid Cloud Extension (HCX)&lt;/a> is an all in one solution for workload mobility. Customers can freely move workloads between multiple on-premises environments as well as VMware Cloud on AWS (VMC). During the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjYP2IuZK6k">VMworld US 2018 day 1 keynote&lt;/a> there were several demos shown, one included a data center evacuation using HCX (51:57). The data center evacuation was using a new HCX migration type called Cloud Motion with vSphere Replication. I’ll cover the HCX migration types in a later post. The workloads were being migrated from an on-premises data center to VMware Cloud on AWS (VMC). The big deal here is the impact during the migration to the users was NONE, ZIP, ZERO downtime. And there was also no replatforming of the workloads or applications.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Stretched Clusters for VMware Cloud on AWS &amp;#8211; Overview</title><link>https://emadyounis.com/dev/blog/2018-05-14-stretched-clusters-overview/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 May 2018 12:30:39 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://emadyounis.com/dev/blog/2018-05-14-stretched-clusters-overview/</guid><description>&lt;p>VMware Cloud on AWS includes resiliency at different layers. We are all familiar with vSphere HA protecting against ESXi host failures. With VMware Cloud on AWS, ESXi hosts reside in an AWS availability zone and are protected by vSphere HA. What about protection for the availability zone the ESXi hosts reside in? While an AWS availability zone failure is a rare occurrence, customers should know they also are protected at this layer as well. A new feature called &lt;a href="https://cloud.vmware.com/vmc-aws/roadmap">Stretched Clusters&lt;/a> for VMware Cloud on AWS is designed to protect against an AWS availability zone failure. Now applications can span multiple AWS availability zones within a VMware Cloud on AWS cluster. If an application instance fails the second instance in another availability zone can take over. This, of course, depends on if the application includes this level of availability. Let’s take a look at the Stretched Clusters feature.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>vCenter Server Architecture Part 1 &amp;#8211; The Basics</title><link>https://emadyounis.com/dev/blog/2018-05-07-vcenter-server-architecture-part-1-the-basics/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 May 2018 14:07:18 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://emadyounis.com/dev/blog/2018-05-07-vcenter-server-architecture-part-1-the-basics/</guid><description>&lt;p>With the release of &lt;a href="http://emadyounis.com/vcenter/vcenter-server-6-7-whats-new-rundown/">vSphere 6.7&lt;/a> and 6.5 U2 comes architectural changes for vCenter Server. vCenter Server is going back to its roots of a simplified deployment model. vCenter Server used to be a single node deployment. The only debate was about its availability. Over time the architecture of vCenter Server has changed introducing a distributed deployment model. Core services like inventory, web client, SSO, and vCenter could run on separate nodes. vCenter Server had the potential of becoming six nodes in this model when adding the VCDB and VUM. The distributed deployment model became too complex for management, maintenance, and upgrades.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>vCenter Server 6.7 What&amp;#8217;s New Rundown</title><link>https://emadyounis.com/dev/blog/2018-04-17-vcenter-server-6-7-whats-new-rundown/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Apr 2018 05:02:47 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://emadyounis.com/dev/blog/2018-04-17-vcenter-server-6-7-whats-new-rundown/</guid><description>&lt;p>Today VMware launched &lt;a href="http://vmw.re/vsphere67launch">vSphere 6.7&lt;/a> and there are lots of new enhancements in this release. But first the news. This is the final release for both vCenter Server for Windows and the vSphere Web Client (flash). The vCenter Server path is set and has been for a while with the vCenter Server Appliance (VCSA). The vSphere Client (HTLM5) is getting close to feature complete in this release.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>New Resource &amp;#8211; The VMware vSphere 6.5 Upgrade eBook</title><link>https://emadyounis.com/dev/blog/2018-03-19-new-resource-vmware-vsphere-6-5-upgrade-ebook/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Mar 2018 11:16:36 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://emadyounis.com/dev/blog/2018-03-19-new-resource-vmware-vsphere-6-5-upgrade-ebook/</guid><description>&lt;p>Over the past year I have written several blog posts and conducted workshops on vSphere 6.5 upgrades. The intent was to help customers learn about the upgrade concepts and planning. Only by getting familiar with the concepts and planning accordingly will the execution be successful. Part of the upgrade journey is knowing what resources are available, where to find them, and how to use them . It gives me great pleasure to announce “&lt;a href="https://secure.vmware.com/45026_REG?touch=1&amp;amp;cid=70134000001SpfU">The Upgrading to VMware vSphere 6.5″ eBook&lt;/a>.

HLM provides the ability to extend an administrator’s management view from on-premises to VMC. This may sound oddly familiar if you are using Enhanced Linked Mode (ELM) in your on-premises environment. There are differences between ELM and HLM in their requirements, how they work, and what problem each is solving. William Lam has a post outlining the differences between the two features &lt;a href="https://www.virtuallyghetto.com/2017/09/enhanced-linked-mode-elm-vs-hybrid-linked-mode-hlm.html">here&lt;/a>.

Error: ovftool is not available”&lt;/strong>. Let me start by saying this is &lt;strong>not&lt;/strong> an issue with the VCSA 6.5 ISO or installer, it has to do with a change in Sierra. Also, before I go any further, Sierra &lt;strong>is currently not supported&lt;/strong> with the VCSA 6.5 installer. Engineering is working to support Sierra in a future update.

VMware’s direction for vCenter Server is the VCSA and it’s quite evident from this release. The VCSA and its Windows counterpart remain on par when it comes to scalability. From an operational and feature perspective, the VCSA has advantages. This post is a quick rundown of the VCSA 6.5, I’ll go into more details in future blog posts.

The vSphere Web Client would be the future management tool replacing the vSphere client aka “Legacy, Thick or C# Client”. This would be become more evident over time with each release of vSphere. New features could only be managed through the vSphere Web Client. While the concept of a browser based client is a step in the right direction, the dependency of flash was not. Keep in mind the decision to use flash was made when it was the standard for web applications, times and standards have changed. With that change it has taken some time to work on replatforming the vSphere Web Client. This always leads to the question, when will we see a HTML5 version of the Web Client?

Luckily, the SSO configuration with VIO is fairly simple. When used with vSphere 5.5 it requires IP or FQDN of your vSphere SSO along with port 7444. With vSphere 6.0 you don’t have to use a port, it’s that easy. I ran into this error while installing VIO.

&lt;p>In a perfect datacenter environment, we would all have an additional area for Dev/Test. This is not always the case and we don’t always have the resources readily available to us. Most of us get creative using what old equipment we have. Some carve out a section in their infrastructure, while others leverage the cloud. Currently I’ve been using &lt;span style="color: #0000ff;">&lt;strong>&lt;a href="http://www.ravellosystems.com/">Ravello&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>&lt;/span> as my Dev/Test area of my lab for VIO. A VIO production-ready deployment requires a significant amount of resources. These same resources may not be instantly available in some environments. The current deployment architecture of VIO requires 15 VMs with a total of 56CPUs and 192GB RAM; details can be found &lt;strong>&lt;span style="color: #0000ff;">&lt;a href="http://pubs.vmware.com/integrated-openstack-1/topic/com.vmware.ICbase/PDF/integrated-openstack-101-getting-started-guide.pdf">here&lt;/a>&lt;/span>&lt;/strong>.

One of the requirements is to leverage your current VMware infrastructure. Of course your plate is already full, and now you need to learn a new platform. Here are a few things that should ease your mind when considering OpenStack. First, OpenStack is a framework that can use your current hardware and software infrastructure. Second, OpenStack services allow integration at the software layer with vendors like VMware. Finally, OpenStack uses drivers to translate requests to calls on the software infrastructure. Why is this important? Let’s take a look at VMware Integrated OpenStack (VIO) to answer these questions.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>VM Time Travel with Tintri&amp;#8217;s SyncVM</title><link>https://emadyounis.com/dev/blog/2015-04-21-vm-time-travel-with-tintris-syncvm/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Apr 2015 09:05:25 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://emadyounis.com/dev/blog/2015-04-21-vm-time-travel-with-tintris-syncvm/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://emadyounis.com/assets/img/2015/04/sync_vm.jpg?resize=250%2C80" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Time travel has always been a fascinating concept in our society. Think of the possibilities with the ability to move forward or backwards in time. There even is the idea of an alternate universe. The concept of time travel is so huge that we have several books, TV shows, and movies based on it. If only we had a time machine, like in Back to the Future! The latest release of Tintri’s OS 3.2 includes several new features. SyncVM is one them. The new SyncVM feature lets you experience time travel via your VMs. SyncVM leverages snapshot capabilities to move back and forth in time. This can be at the VM level. SyncVM also lets you propagate changes at a vDisk level from one VM to a set of VMs.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>VMware VCP6-DCV Beta Availability</title><link>https://emadyounis.com/dev/blog/2015-04-01-vmware-vcp6-dcv-beta-availability/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Apr 2015 09:09:56 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://emadyounis.com/dev/blog/2015-04-01-vmware-vcp6-dcv-beta-availability/</guid><description>&lt;p>VCP6-DCV is now ready to be taken, well sort of.

In a nutshell this is a handshake.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>VeeamON 2014 Recap</title><link>https://emadyounis.com/dev/blog/2014-10-13-veeamon-2014-recap/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Oct 2014 09:40:32 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://emadyounis.com/dev/blog/2014-10-13-veeamon-2014-recap/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://emadyounis.com/assets/img/2014/10/veeamon.jpg?resize=300%2C39" alt="veeamon">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Last week I had the opportunity to be one of the 1200 + (estimated) in attendance for &lt;a href="http://go.veeam.com/veeamon">VeeamON&lt;/a> in Las Vegas, a conference themed around datacenter availability. Of course remember what happens in Vegas, goes on twitter #VeeamON. The conference was filled with lots of activities such as lab warz, tour of the modern datacenter and training for the Veeam Certified Engineer (VMCE) just to name a few. Although three days, well four for those who attended the VMCE training, the agenda was quite full:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>NetApp Simulator Cluster Mode Getting Started Part 3</title><link>https://emadyounis.com/dev/blog/2014-09-05-netapp-simulator-cluster-mode-getting-started-part-3/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Sep 2014 12:00:38 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://emadyounis.com/dev/blog/2014-09-05-netapp-simulator-cluster-mode-getting-started-part-3/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;">&lt;strong>Preparing the **&lt;strong>DataONTAP*&lt;/strong>* 2nd Simulator Node&lt;/strong> &lt;/span>&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Upload the 2nd node simulator files to an existing or create a new datastore.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Register the simulator VM (right click .vmx file and register VM).&lt;/li>

They can also serve as test platforms for updates, scripts, migrations, etc without the fear of affecting your production environment and causing a resume generating event. NetApp simulates its Data ONTAP software allowing for support for a majority of its functionality within a virtual environment. Supported VMware environments consists of Workstation, Player, Fusion and vSphere. This install process covers deploying the Data ONTAP simulator in cluster mode on a vSphere 5.5 lab environment.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
