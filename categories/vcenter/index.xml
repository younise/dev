This means all the required vCenter Server services are running on the same node. The release of &lt;a href="http://emadyounis.com/whats-new-in-vcenter-server-6-7-update-1/">vSphere 6.7 Update 1 introduces the convergence CLI tool&lt;/a>. Customers with an existing external deployment can now change their topology to embedded. This deployment model also supports Enhanced Linked Mode (ELM). In the past, an external Platform Services Controller (PSC) was only needed for ELM. This is no longer the case with a simplified deployment model. While we are on the subject, let me clear up a few misconceptions I’ve seen about embedded deployments.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>What&amp;#8217;s New in vCenter Server 6.7 Update 1</title><link>https://demo.gethugothemes.com/bookworm-light/blog/2018-10-16-whats-new-in-vcenter-server-6-7-update-1/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Oct 2018 13:18:55 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://demo.gethugothemes.com/bookworm-light/blog/2018-10-16-whats-new-in-vcenter-server-6-7-update-1/</guid><description>&lt;p>Today I’m happy to announce &lt;a href="https://my.vmware.com/en/web/vmware/info/slug/datacenter_cloud_infrastructure/vmware_vsphere/6_7">vSphere 6.7 Update 1&lt;/a> is now generally available. This release includes a single vSphere Client to manage them all. I’m referring to the HTML5 based vSphere Client, now fully featured. Also, included in this release are the necessary tools for convergence and repointing. An external Platform Services Controller (PSC) for enhanced linked mode is a thing of the past. Customers can now convert to a simplified embedded deployment supporting the same functionality.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>vCenter Server Architecture Part 1 &amp;#8211; The Basics</title><link>https://demo.gethugothemes.com/bookworm-light/blog/2018-05-07-vcenter-server-architecture-part-1-the-basics/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 May 2018 14:07:18 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://demo.gethugothemes.com/bookworm-light/blog/2018-05-07-vcenter-server-architecture-part-1-the-basics/</guid><description>&lt;p>With the release of &lt;a href="http://emadyounis.com/vcenter/vcenter-server-6-7-whats-new-rundown/">vSphere 6.7&lt;/a> and 6.5 U2 comes architectural changes for vCenter Server. vCenter Server is going back to its roots of a simplified deployment model. vCenter Server used to be a single node deployment. The only debate was about its availability. Over time the architecture of vCenter Server has changed introducing a distributed deployment model. Core services like inventory, web client, SSO, and vCenter could run on separate nodes. vCenter Server had the potential of becoming six nodes in this model when adding the VCDB and VUM. The distributed deployment model became too complex for management, maintenance, and upgrades.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>vCenter Server 6.7 What&amp;#8217;s New Rundown</title><link>https://demo.gethugothemes.com/bookworm-light/blog/2018-04-17-vcenter-server-6-7-whats-new-rundown/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Apr 2018 05:02:47 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://demo.gethugothemes.com/bookworm-light/blog/2018-04-17-vcenter-server-6-7-whats-new-rundown/</guid><description>&lt;p>Today VMware launched &lt;a href="http://vmw.re/vsphere67launch">vSphere 6.7&lt;/a> and there are lots of new enhancements in this release. But first the news. This is the final release for both vCenter Server for Windows and the vSphere Web Client (flash). The vCenter Server path is set and has been for a while with the vCenter Server Appliance (VCSA). The vSphere Client (HTLM5) is getting close to feature complete in this release.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Printing #migrate2vcsa Stickers and Apparel</title><link>https://demo.gethugothemes.com/bookworm-light/blog/2017-01-05-printing-migrate2vcsa-stickers-and-apparel/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Jan 2017 09:54:36 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://demo.gethugothemes.com/bookworm-light/blog/2017-01-05-printing-migrate2vcsa-stickers-and-apparel/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;span style="color: #ff0000;">&lt;strong>[Updated to include more VCSA and VMware Cloud on AWS Stickers]&lt;/strong>&lt;/span>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Happy New Year! 2016 was a big year for the vCenter Server Appliance (VCSA). We now have officially supported Migration Tools in &lt;strong>&lt;span style="color: #3366ff;">&lt;a href="https://blogs.vmware.com/vsphere/2016/09/vcenter-server-migration-tool-vsphere-6-0-update-2m.html">vSphere 6.0 U2m&lt;/a>&lt;/span>&lt;/strong> and vSphere 6.5. With the release of vSphere 6.5, the VCSA has surpassed its Windows counterpart in terms of &lt;a href="http://emadyounis.com/vcenter/vcenter-server-appliance-vcsa-6-5-whats-new-rundown/">&lt;strong>&lt;span style="color: #3366ff;">features and performance&lt;/span>&lt;/strong>&lt;/a>. Then there was the hot swag that debuted at both VMworld US and Barcelona, in the form of stickers and shirts. Yes, there were hoodies too 🙂&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>vCenter Server Appliance (VCSA) 6.5 Installer macOS Ovftool Error</title><link>https://demo.gethugothemes.com/bookworm-light/blog/2016-11-21-vcenter-server-appliance-vcsa-6-5-installer-macos-ovftool-error/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Nov 2016 12:42:43 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://demo.gethugothemes.com/bookworm-light/blog/2016-11-21-vcenter-server-appliance-vcsa-6-5-installer-macos-ovftool-error/</guid><description>&lt;p>Recently, some macOS Sierra users have had an issue with the VCSA 6.5 installer. At the “Set up appliance VM” (step 5), the VCSA deployment and storage sizes are not available. The following error is received &lt;strong>“A problem occurred while reading the OVF file.. Error: ovftool is not available”&lt;/strong>. Let me start by saying this is &lt;strong>not&lt;/strong> an issue with the VCSA 6.5 ISO or installer, it has to do with a change in Sierra. Also, before I go any further, Sierra &lt;strong>is currently not supported&lt;/strong> with the VCSA 6.5 installer. Engineering is working to support Sierra in a future update. The supported system requirements for the VCSA installer are &lt;span style="color: #0000ff;">&lt;strong>&lt;a href="http://pubs.vmware.com/vsphere-65/index.jsp#com.vmware.vsphere.install.doc/GUID-BA4FA18C-1049-42AA-A5CD-DE863565251B.html#GUID-BA4FA18C-1049-42AA-A5CD-DE863565251B">here&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>&lt;/span>. With that said, I want to shed more light on why this is happening and what options are available with Sierra.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>vCenter Server Appliance (VCSA) 6.5 Installer Improvements</title><link>https://demo.gethugothemes.com/bookworm-light/blog/2016-11-15-vcenter-server-appliance-vcsa-6-5-installer-improvements/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Nov 2016 06:57:47 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://demo.gethugothemes.com/bookworm-light/blog/2016-11-15-vcenter-server-appliance-vcsa-6-5-installer-improvements/</guid><description>&lt;p>The vCenter Server Appliance (VCSA) 6.5 has significant new features and improvements mentioned &lt;strong>&lt;a href="http://emadyounis.com/vcenter/vcenter-server-appliance-vcsa-6-5-whats-new-rundown/">here&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>. One area of notice is the installer, which in this release not only has a new look and feel but other improvements. These improvements are not only visible from the ISO, but also during the deployment. The end result is a better experience throughout the VCSA deployment process.

With lots of new features and updates, this is one of the biggest vSphere releases we have had in a while. Leading the charge is none other than the vCenter Server Appliance (VCSA). VMware’s direction for vCenter Server is the VCSA and it’s quite evident from this release. The VCSA and its Windows counterpart remain on par when it comes to scalability. From an operational and feature perspective, the VCSA has advantages. This post is a quick rundown of the VCSA 6.5, I’ll go into more details in future blog posts. Time to take a look at what’s new and why migrate2vcsa you should 🙂&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>vSphere HTML5 Web Client Fling Hidden Features</title><link>https://demo.gethugothemes.com/bookworm-light/blog/2016-04-15-vsphere-html5-web-client-fling-hidden-features/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Apr 2016 15:53:12 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://demo.gethugothemes.com/bookworm-light/blog/2016-04-15-vsphere-html5-web-client-fling-hidden-features/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://emadyounis.com/assets/img/2016/04/HTML5-Fling-icon-1.1.png?resize=166%2C166" alt="">I recently wrote about the &lt;span style="color: #3366ff;">&lt;strong>&lt;a href="http://emadyounis.com/vcenter/new-fling-vsphere-html5-web-client/">release of the vSphere HTML5 Web Client Fling&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>&lt;/span> and &lt;span style="color: #3366ff;">&lt;strong>&lt;a href="http://blogs.vmware.com/vsphere/2016/03/vsphere-html5-web-client-fling-getting-started.html">how to configure&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> &lt;/span>it.

The vSphere Web Client would be the future management tool replacing the vSphere client aka “Legacy, Thick or C# Client”. This would be become more evident over time with each release of vSphere. New features could only be managed through the vSphere Web Client. While the concept of a browser based client is a step in the right direction, the dependency of flash was not. Keep in mind the decision to use flash was made when it was the standard for web applications, times and standards have changed. With that change it has taken some time to work on replatforming the vSphere Web Client. This always leads to the question, when will we see a HTML5 version of the Web Client? I’m happy to announce the wait is over!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Deploying vCenter Server Appliance (VCSA) 6.0 U1 on Ravello</title><link>https://demo.gethugothemes.com/bookworm-light/blog/2015-12-07-deploying-vcenter-server-appliance-vcsa-6-0-u1-on-ravello/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Dec 2015 07:00:01 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://demo.gethugothemes.com/bookworm-light/blog/2015-12-07-deploying-vcenter-server-appliance-vcsa-6-0-u1-on-ravello/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://emadyounis.com/assets/img/2015/12/VCSA-Ravello.png?resize=183%2C203" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This blog post allows me to bring two of my favorite things together. I have been a fan of the vCenter Server Appliance (VCSA) since its release. With continuous improvements, it’s evident that VCSA is the future. My other favorite thing is &lt;span style="color: #0000ff;">&lt;strong>&lt;a href="http://www.ravellosystems.com">Ravello&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>&lt;/span>. They have given us the ability to have a home lab in the cloud, extend our current labs, and share blueprints. Two great products, that up to this point were not able to be used together. This is like having peanut butter on one slice and jelly on the other, and eating them individually.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>vCenter Server Appliance (VCSA) 6.0 Update 1 Rundown</title><link>https://demo.gethugothemes.com/bookworm-light/blog/2015-09-14-vcenter-server-appliance-vcsa-6-0-update-1-rundown/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Sep 2015 08:57:33 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://demo.gethugothemes.com/bookworm-light/blog/2015-09-14-vcenter-server-appliance-vcsa-6-0-update-1-rundown/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;span style="color: #000000;">&lt;img src="https://emadyounis.com/assets/img/2015/09/VCSA-Update-1-Main-Image.png?resize=219%2C119" alt="VCSA Update 1 - Main Image">VMworld 2015 has come and gone, at least the US version.

The scripted deployment is now simplified. You are now provided several templates, 5 to be exact. Now You don’t have to just use the default templates you can add to them or even create your own.

&lt;p>It’s that time again, a new release of vSphere is upon us. Some features we’ve been waiting for a while now, others are new or revamped. It’s evident that VMware has put effort into the vCenter appliance. In previous releases it was lacking several features needed to make it equal to its Windows Counterpart. Well it seems that VMware has heard the many cries, and the appliance is now, in my opinion, ready for prime time. Let’s take a look at what’s new and you decide if you will be a vCenter 6.0 appliance adopter.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
