Luckily, the SSO configuration with VIO is fairly simple. When used with vSphere 5.5 it requires IP or FQDN of your vSphere SSO along with port 7444. With vSphere 6.0 you don’t have to use a port, it’s that easy. I ran into this error while installing VIO. Here is the process I went through.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Unsupported VMware Integrated OpenStack (VIO) Configuration</title><link>https://demo.gethugothemes.com/bookworm-light/blog/2015-07-15-unsupported-vmware-integrated-openstack-vio-configuration/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jul 2015 09:00:54 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://demo.gethugothemes.com/bookworm-light/blog/2015-07-15-unsupported-vmware-integrated-openstack-vio-configuration/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://emadyounis.com/assets/img/2015/07/VIO-Unsupported-Config1.jpg?resize=264%2C300" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In a perfect datacenter environment, we would all have an additional area for Dev/Test. This is not always the case and we don’t always have the resources readily available to us. Most of us get creative using what old equipment we have. Some carve out a section in their infrastructure, while others leverage the cloud. Currently I’ve been using &lt;span style="color: #0000ff;">&lt;strong>&lt;a href="http://www.ravellosystems.com/">Ravello&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>&lt;/span> as my Dev/Test area of my lab for VIO. A VIO production-ready deployment requires a significant amount of resources. These same resources may not be instantly available in some environments. The current deployment architecture of VIO requires 15 VMs with a total of 56CPUs and 192GB RAM; details can be found &lt;strong>&lt;span style="color: #0000ff;">&lt;a href="http://pubs.vmware.com/integrated-openstack-1/topic/com.vmware.ICbase/PDF/integrated-openstack-101-getting-started-guide.pdf">here&lt;/a>&lt;/span>&lt;/strong>. This doesn’t take into account if you’re using NSX. However, there are a few ways you can be conservative with VIO resources. Let me state up front: the following setup is not supported by VMware for production.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ravello Lab Setup for VMware Integrated OpenStack (VIO) Part 2</title><link>https://demo.gethugothemes.com/bookworm-light/blog/2015-06-26-ravello-lab-setup-for-vmware-integrated-openstack-vio-part-2/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Jun 2015 06:33:58 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://demo.gethugothemes.com/bookworm-light/blog/2015-06-26-ravello-lab-setup-for-vmware-integrated-openstack-vio-part-2/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://emadyounis.com/assets/img/2015/06/Ravello-with-VIO-Part-2.png?resize=300%2C113" alt="">Previously, we talked about the prerequisites (&lt;span style="color: #0000ff;">&lt;strong>&lt;a href="http://emadyounis.com/openstack/ravello-lab-setup-for-vmware-integrated-openstack-vio-part-1/">link&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>&lt;/span>) needed for a successful VIO deployment.

One of the requirements is to leverage your current VMware infrastructure. Of course your plate is already full, and now you need to learn a new platform. Here are a few things that should ease your mind when considering OpenStack. First, OpenStack is a framework that can use your current hardware and software infrastructure. Second, OpenStack services allow integration at the software layer with vendors like VMware. Finally, OpenStack uses drivers to translate requests to calls on the software infrastructure. Why is this important? Let’s take a look at VMware Integrated OpenStack (VIO) to answer these questions.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
