Reassessing what’s going on in their lives and what change, if any do they want to introduce. It’s usually the most common time for new job opportunities or changes to occur.

While these types of job changes aren’t easy, they’re needed to get us to the next step of our journey.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>I&amp;#8217;m Going West</title><link>https://emadyounis.com/dev/blog/2015-03-25-im-going-west/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Mar 2015 14:14:47 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://emadyounis.com/dev/blog/2015-03-25-im-going-west/</guid><description>&lt;p>During my career I have had the opportunity to work as both a customer and partner. As a customer I worked for large enterprise environments. I did design, implementation, and troubleshooting. This was great but was all done within a silo, with a limited scope. When I went to work for a partner things changed. I got to see different environments and had to develop a different mind set. I got exposure and access to tools and portals that I wouldn’t have as a customer. Also there was more focus on learning and training. In each role I developed new skills and grew. I also had the opportunity to work and learn from a lot of amazing people.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
