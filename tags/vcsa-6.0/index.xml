&lt;p>This blog post allows me to bring two of my favorite things together. I have been a fan of the vCenter Server Appliance (VCSA) since its release. With continuous improvements, it’s evident that VCSA is the future. My other favorite thing is &lt;span style="color: #0000ff;">&lt;strong>&lt;a href="http://www.ravellosystems.com">Ravello&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>&lt;/span>. They have given us the ability to have a home lab in the cloud, extend our current labs, and share blueprints. Two great products, that up to this point were not able to be used together.

There were several sessions giving love to vCenter. This included the vCenter Server Appliance (VCSA). Here are a few of the sessions that are worth a look.&lt;/span>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>vCenter Appliance (VCSA) 6.0 Scripted Install</title><link>https://emadyounis.com/dev/blog/2015-03-24-vcenter-appliance-vcsa-6-0-scripted-install/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Mar 2015 15:10:36 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://emadyounis.com/dev/blog/2015-03-24-vcenter-appliance-vcsa-6-0-scripted-install/</guid><description>&lt;p>The VCSA 6.0 has two deployment types, guided and scripted. The scripted deployment is now simplified. You are now provided several templates, 5 to be exact. Now You don’t have to just use the default templates you can add to them or even create your own. Getting started is not that hard; once all the necessary information is available. The templates are usable from a command prompt or PowerShell.
