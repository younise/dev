This means all the required vCenter Server services are running on the same node. The release of &lt;a href="http://emadyounis.com/whats-new-in-vcenter-server-6-7-update-1/">vSphere 6.7 Update 1 introduces the convergence CLI tool&lt;/a>. Customers with an existing external deployment can now change their topology to embedded. This deployment model also supports Enhanced Linked Mode (ELM). In the past, an external Platform Services Controller (PSC) was only needed for ELM. This is no longer the case with a simplified deployment model. While we are on the subject, let me clear up a few misconceptions I’ve seen about embedded deployments.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>What&amp;#8217;s New in vCenter Server 6.7 Update 1</title><link>https://demo.gethugothemes.com/bookworm-light/blog/2018-10-16-whats-new-in-vcenter-server-6-7-update-1/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Oct 2018 13:18:55 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://demo.gethugothemes.com/bookworm-light/blog/2018-10-16-whats-new-in-vcenter-server-6-7-update-1/</guid><description>&lt;p>Today I’m happy to announce &lt;a href="https://my.vmware.com/en/web/vmware/info/slug/datacenter_cloud_infrastructure/vmware_vsphere/6_7">vSphere 6.7 Update 1&lt;/a> is now generally available. This release includes a single vSphere Client to manage them all. I’m referring to the HTML5 based vSphere Client, now fully featured. Also, included in this release are the necessary tools for convergence and repointing. An external Platform Services Controller (PSC) for enhanced linked mode is a thing of the past. Customers can now convert to a simplified embedded deployment supporting the same functionality.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>vCenter Server 6.7 What&amp;#8217;s New Rundown</title><link>https://demo.gethugothemes.com/bookworm-light/blog/2018-04-17-vcenter-server-6-7-whats-new-rundown/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Apr 2018 05:02:47 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://demo.gethugothemes.com/bookworm-light/blog/2018-04-17-vcenter-server-6-7-whats-new-rundown/</guid><description>&lt;p>Today VMware launched &lt;a href="http://vmw.re/vsphere67launch">vSphere 6.7&lt;/a> and there are lots of new enhancements in this release. But first the news. This is the final release for both vCenter Server for Windows and the vSphere Web Client (flash). The vCenter Server path is set and has been for a while with the vCenter Server Appliance (VCSA). The vSphere Client (HTLM5) is getting close to feature complete in this release.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
