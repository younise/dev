This means all the required vCenter Server services are running on the same node. The release of &lt;a href="http://emadyounis.com/whats-new-in-vcenter-server-6-7-update-1/">vSphere 6.7 Update 1 introduces the convergence CLI tool&lt;/a>. Customers with an existing external deployment can now change their topology to embedded. This deployment model also supports Enhanced Linked Mode (ELM). In the past, an external Platform Services Controller (PSC) was only needed for ELM. This is no longer the case with a simplified deployment model. While we are on the subject, let me clear up a few misconceptions I’ve seen about embedded deployments.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>What&amp;#8217;s New in vCenter Server 6.7 Update 1</title><link>https://emadyounis.com/dev/blog/2018-10-16-whats-new-in-vcenter-server-6-7-update-1/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Oct 2018 13:18:55 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://emadyounis.com/dev/blog/2018-10-16-whats-new-in-vcenter-server-6-7-update-1/</guid><description>&lt;p>Today I’m happy to announce &lt;a href="https://my.vmware.com/en/web/vmware/info/slug/datacenter_cloud_infrastructure/vmware_vsphere/6_7">vSphere 6.7 Update 1&lt;/a> is now generally available. This release includes a single vSphere Client to manage them all. I’m referring to the HTML5 based vSphere Client, now fully featured. Also, included in this release are the necessary tools for convergence and repointing. An external Platform Services Controller (PSC) for enhanced linked mode is a thing of the past. Customers can now convert to a simplified embedded deployment supporting the same functionality.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>vCenter Server 6.7 What&amp;#8217;s New Rundown</title><link>https://emadyounis.com/dev/blog/2018-04-17-vcenter-server-6-7-whats-new-rundown/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Apr 2018 05:02:47 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://emadyounis.com/dev/blog/2018-04-17-vcenter-server-6-7-whats-new-rundown/</guid><description>&lt;p>Today VMware launched &lt;a href="http://vmw.re/vsphere67launch">vSphere 6.7&lt;/a> and there are lots of new enhancements in this release. But first the news. This is the final release for both vCenter Server for Windows and the vSphere Web Client (flash). The vCenter Server path is set and has been for a while with the vCenter Server Appliance (VCSA). The vSphere Client (HTLM5) is getting close to feature complete in this release.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Printing #migrate2vcsa Stickers and Apparel</title><link>https://emadyounis.com/dev/blog/2017-01-05-printing-migrate2vcsa-stickers-and-apparel/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Jan 2017 09:54:36 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://emadyounis.com/dev/blog/2017-01-05-printing-migrate2vcsa-stickers-and-apparel/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;span style="color: #ff0000;">&lt;strong>[Updated to include more VCSA and VMware Cloud on AWS Stickers]&lt;/strong>&lt;/span>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Happy New Year! 2016 was a big year for the vCenter Server Appliance (VCSA). We now have officially supported Migration Tools in &lt;strong>&lt;span style="color: #3366ff;">&lt;a href="https://blogs.vmware.com/vsphere/2016/09/vcenter-server-migration-tool-vsphere-6-0-update-2m.html">vSphere 6.0 U2m&lt;/a>&lt;/span>&lt;/strong> and vSphere 6.5. With the release of vSphere 6.5, the VCSA has surpassed its Windows counterpart in terms of &lt;a href="http://emadyounis.com/vcenter/vcenter-server-appliance-vcsa-6-5-whats-new-rundown/">&lt;strong>&lt;span style="color: #3366ff;">features and performance&lt;/span>&lt;/strong>&lt;/a>. Then there was the hot swag that debuted at both VMworld US and Barcelona, in the form of stickers and shirts. Yes, there were hoodies too 🙂&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>vCenter Server Appliance (VCSA) 6.5 Installer macOS Ovftool Error</title><link>https://emadyounis.com/dev/blog/2016-11-21-vcenter-server-appliance-vcsa-6-5-installer-macos-ovftool-error/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Nov 2016 12:42:43 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://emadyounis.com/dev/blog/2016-11-21-vcenter-server-appliance-vcsa-6-5-installer-macos-ovftool-error/</guid><description>&lt;p>Recently, some macOS Sierra users have had an issue with the VCSA 6.5 installer. At the “Set up appliance VM” (step 5), the VCSA deployment and storage sizes are not available. The following error is received &lt;strong>“A problem occurred while reading the OVF file.. Error: ovftool is not available”&lt;/strong>. Let me start by saying this is &lt;strong>not&lt;/strong> an issue with the VCSA 6.5 ISO or installer, it has to do with a change in Sierra. Also, before I go any further, Sierra &lt;strong>is currently not supported&lt;/strong> with the VCSA 6.5 installer. Engineering is working to support Sierra in a future update. The supported system requirements for the VCSA installer are &lt;span style="color: #0000ff;">&lt;strong>&lt;a href="http://pubs.vmware.com/vsphere-65/index.jsp#com.vmware.vsphere.install.doc/GUID-BA4FA18C-1049-42AA-A5CD-DE863565251B.html#GUID-BA4FA18C-1049-42AA-A5CD-DE863565251B">here&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>&lt;/span>. With that said, I want to shed more light on why this is happening and what options are available with Sierra.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>vCenter Server Appliance (VCSA) 6.5 Installer Improvements</title><link>https://emadyounis.com/dev/blog/2016-11-15-vcenter-server-appliance-vcsa-6-5-installer-improvements/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Nov 2016 06:57:47 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://emadyounis.com/dev/blog/2016-11-15-vcenter-server-appliance-vcsa-6-5-installer-improvements/</guid><description>&lt;p>The vCenter Server Appliance (VCSA) 6.5 has significant new features and improvements mentioned &lt;strong>&lt;a href="http://emadyounis.com/vcenter/vcenter-server-appliance-vcsa-6-5-whats-new-rundown/">here&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>. One area of notice is the installer, which in this release not only has a new look and feel but other improvements. These improvements are not only visible from the ISO, but also during the deployment. The end result is a better experience throughout the VCSA deployment process. Let’s jump in and take a closer look.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>vCenter Server Appliance (VCSA) 6.5 What&amp;#8217;s New Rundown</title><link>https://emadyounis.com/dev/blog/2016-10-31-vcenter-server-appliance-vcsa-6-5-whats-new-rundown/</link><pubDate>Mon, 31 Oct 2016 07:05:53 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://emadyounis.com/dev/blog/2016-10-31-vcenter-server-appliance-vcsa-6-5-whats-new-rundown/</guid><description>&lt;p>During VMworld Barcelona 2016, VMware announced vSphere 6.5. With lots of new features and updates, this is one of the biggest vSphere releases we have had in a while. Leading the charge is none other than the vCenter Server Appliance (VCSA). VMware’s direction for vCenter Server is the VCSA and it’s quite evident from this release. The VCSA and its Windows counterpart remain on par when it comes to scalability. From an operational and feature perspective, the VCSA has advantages. This post is a quick rundown of the VCSA 6.5, I’ll go into more details in future blog posts. Time to take a look at what’s new and why migrate2vcsa you should 🙂&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Deploying vCenter Server Appliance (VCSA) 6.0 U1 on Ravello</title><link>https://emadyounis.com/dev/blog/2015-12-07-deploying-vcenter-server-appliance-vcsa-6-0-u1-on-ravello/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Dec 2015 07:00:01 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://emadyounis.com/dev/blog/2015-12-07-deploying-vcenter-server-appliance-vcsa-6-0-u1-on-ravello/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://emadyounis.com/assets/img/2015/12/VCSA-Ravello.png?resize=183%2C203" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This blog post allows me to bring two of my favorite things together. I have been a fan of the vCenter Server Appliance (VCSA) since its release. With continuous improvements, it’s evident that VCSA is the future. My other favorite thing is &lt;span style="color: #0000ff;">&lt;strong>&lt;a href="http://www.ravellosystems.com">Ravello&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>&lt;/span>. They have given us the ability to have a home lab in the cloud, extend our current labs, and share blueprints. Two great products, that up to this point were not able to be used together. This is like having peanut butter on one slice and jelly on the other, and eating them individually.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>vCenter Appliance (VCSA) 6.0 Scripted Install</title><link>https://emadyounis.com/dev/blog/2015-03-24-vcenter-appliance-vcsa-6-0-scripted-install/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Mar 2015 15:10:36 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://emadyounis.com/dev/blog/2015-03-24-vcenter-appliance-vcsa-6-0-scripted-install/</guid><description>&lt;p>The VCSA 6.0 has two deployment types, guided and scripted. The scripted deployment is now simplified. You are now provided several templates, 5 to be exact. Now You don’t have to just use the default templates you can add to them or even create your own. Getting started is not that hard; once all the necessary information is available. The templates are usable from a command prompt or PowerShell. Let’s walk through how to use both.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
