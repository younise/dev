HLM provides the ability to extend an administratorâ€™s management view from on-premises to VMC. This may sound oddly familiar if you are using Enhanced Linked Mode (ELM) in your on-premises environment. There are differences between ELM and HLM in their requirements, how they work, and what problem each is solving. William Lam has a post outlining the differences between the two features &lt;a href="https://www.virtuallyghetto.com/2017/09/enhanced-linked-mode-elm-vs-hybrid-linked-mode-hlm.html">here&lt;/a>. This post will go into detail on how to get HLM implemented.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
