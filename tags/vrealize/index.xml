It also handles machine life cycle, governance, and decommissioning to name a few. IaaS also has some muscle behind it in regards to extensibility. Before getting too far in this discussion, let’s go through the IaaS installation process.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>vRealize Automation 6.1 (formally vCAC) – Scripted IaaS Database</title><link>https://demo.gethugothemes.com/bookworm-light/blog/2014-12-12-vrealize-automation-6-1-formally-vcac-scripted-iaas-database/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Dec 2014 11:00:59 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://demo.gethugothemes.com/bookworm-light/blog/2014-12-12-vrealize-automation-6-1-formally-vcac-scripted-iaas-database/</guid><description>&lt;p>Recently we discussed &lt;a href="http://emadyounis.com/vrealize-automation/vrealize-automation-6-1-formally-vcac-iaas-database/" title="vRealize Automation 6.1 (formally vCAC) – IaaS Database">how to setup the IaaS database&lt;/a>. Did you know there are scripts available to do the IaaS database install? There is a catch to using the scripts to pre-create the IaaS database, anyone? anyone? A pre-created IaaS database will only work with the custom install (distributed) for the IaaS Server. This supports the two scripted methods, but more on that later.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>vRealize Automation 6.1 (formally vCAC) – IaaS Database</title><link>https://demo.gethugothemes.com/bookworm-light/blog/2014-12-05-vrealize-automation-6-1-formally-vcac-iaas-database/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Dec 2014 10:00:35 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://demo.gethugothemes.com/bookworm-light/blog/2014-12-05-vrealize-automation-6-1-formally-vcac-iaas-database/</guid><description>&lt;p>Up to this point we had the convenience of deploying appliances for both &lt;a href="http://emadyounis.com/vrealize-automation/vrealize-automation-6-1-formally-vcloud-automation-center-identity-appliance-deployment-configuration/" title="vRealize Automation 6.1 (formally vCloud Automation Center) – Identity Appliance – Deployment / Configuration">SSO&lt;/a> &amp;amp; &lt;a href="http://emadyounis.com/vrealize-automation/vrealize-automation-6-1-formally-vcac-vra-appliance-deployment-configuration/" title="vRealize Automation 6.1 (formally vCAC) – vRA Appliance Deployment &amp;amp; Configuration">vRA&lt;/a>. The deployment of the Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) requires Microsoft Windows &amp;amp; SQL. IaaS uses Microsoft SQL to maintain information about managed virtual machines and policies. Microsoft SQL can either be a remote server deployment or local with IaaS. So before we can setup IaaS we need to have SQL installed, let’s get started.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>vRealize Automation 6.1 (formally vCAC) – vRA Appliance Deployment &amp;#038; Configuration</title><link>https://demo.gethugothemes.com/bookworm-light/blog/2014-11-20-vrealize-automation-6-1-formally-vcac-vra-appliance-deployment-configuration/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2014 17:43:28 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://demo.gethugothemes.com/bookworm-light/blog/2014-11-20-vrealize-automation-6-1-formally-vcac-vra-appliance-deployment-configuration/</guid><description>&lt;p>At this point we have deployed &amp;amp; configured SSO, of course with HA and backups in mind. The next piece is the vRealize Automation appliance (vRA). The vRA appliance provides cloud management &amp;amp; a self-service portal for vRA. We are now going walk through the deployment and configuration of the appliance.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>vRealize Automation 6.1 (formally vCAC) &amp;#8211; Identity Appliance High Availability &amp;#038; Backup</title><link>https://demo.gethugothemes.com/bookworm-light/blog/2014-11-13-vrealize-automation-6-1-formally-vcac-identity-appliance-high-availability-backup/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2014 10:15:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://demo.gethugothemes.com/bookworm-light/blog/2014-11-13-vrealize-automation-6-1-formally-vcac-identity-appliance-high-availability-backup/</guid><description>&lt;p>In a &lt;a href="http://emadyounis.com/vrealize-automation/vrealize-automation-6-1-formally-vcloud-automation-center-identity-appliance-deployment-configuration/" title="vRealize Automation 6.1 (formally vCloud Automation Center) – Identity Appliance – Deployment / Configuration">previous post&lt;/a>, we discussed the importance of SSO as it relates to vRA (vRealize Automation). We also demonstrated how to deploy &amp;amp; configure the vRA identity appliance. Due to the nature of the identity appliance we need to make sure that SSO is in a high available state. There currently is no native HA feature built in, so what are our options for protecting the identity appliance you ask? Here are some options:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>vRealize Automation 6.1 (formally vCloud Automation Center) &amp;#8211; Identity Appliance &amp;#8211; Deployment / Configuration</title><link>https://demo.gethugothemes.com/bookworm-light/blog/2014-11-05-vrealize-automation-6-1-formally-vcloud-automation-center-identity-appliance-deployment-configuration/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2014 11:16:48 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://demo.gethugothemes.com/bookworm-light/blog/2014-11-05-vrealize-automation-6-1-formally-vcloud-automation-center-identity-appliance-deployment-configuration/</guid><description>&lt;p>The introduction of Single Sign On (SSO) in vSphere 5.1 has provided a new major dependency of the infrastructure. SSO provides a secure way of authenticating to your vSphere environment. It not only serves as an authentication broker but also a token exchange, so what does this all mean you? In a nutshell this is a handshake.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
