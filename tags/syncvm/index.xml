&lt;p>Time travel has always been a fascinating concept in our society. Think of the possibilities with the ability to move forward or backwards in time. There even is the idea of an alternate universe. The concept of time travel is so huge that we have several books, TV shows, and movies based on it. If only we had a time machine, like in Back to the Future! The latest release of Tintriâ€™s OS 3.2 includes several new features. SyncVM is one them. The new SyncVM feature lets you experience time travel via your VMs. SyncVM leverages snapshot capabilities to move back and forth in time. This can be at the VM level. SyncVM also lets you propagate changes at a vDisk level from one VM to a set of VMs.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
