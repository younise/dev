This repository will serve to upgrade both the Identity Appliance and vRA Appliance(s). Before upgrading we need to ensure backups are in place. I know I’m preaching to the choir, but still need to stress the importance. We are not short of ways to backup the environment using VM snapshots (temporarily) and vSphere data protection to name a few. For SQL using a maintenance plan is also an option. The success of the upgrade relies on following the correct order. The steps below follow a simple deployment model but I will try to add areas where a distributed model differs.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>vRealize Automation 6.1 (formally vCAC) &amp;#8211; Identity Appliance High Availability &amp;#038; Backup</title><link>https://emadyounis.com/dev/blog/2014-11-13-vrealize-automation-6-1-formally-vcac-identity-appliance-high-availability-backup/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2014 10:15:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://emadyounis.com/dev/blog/2014-11-13-vrealize-automation-6-1-formally-vcac-identity-appliance-high-availability-backup/</guid><description>&lt;p>In a &lt;a href="http://emadyounis.com/vrealize-automation/vrealize-automation-6-1-formally-vcloud-automation-center-identity-appliance-deployment-configuration/" title="vRealize Automation 6.1 (formally vCloud Automation Center) – Identity Appliance – Deployment / Configuration">previous post&lt;/a>, we discussed the importance of SSO as it relates to vRA (vRealize Automation). We also demonstrated how to deploy &amp;amp; configure the vRA identity appliance. Due to the nature of the identity appliance we need to make sure that SSO is in a high available state. There currently is no native HA feature built in, so what are our options for protecting the identity appliance you ask? Here are some options:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>vRealize Automation 6.1 (formally vCloud Automation Center) &amp;#8211; Identity Appliance &amp;#8211; Deployment / Configuration</title><link>https://emadyounis.com/dev/blog/2014-11-05-vrealize-automation-6-1-formally-vcloud-automation-center-identity-appliance-deployment-configuration/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2014 11:16:48 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://emadyounis.com/dev/blog/2014-11-05-vrealize-automation-6-1-formally-vcloud-automation-center-identity-appliance-deployment-configuration/</guid><description>&lt;p>The introduction of Single Sign On (SSO) in vSphere 5.1 has provided a new major dependency of the infrastructure. SSO provides a secure way of authenticating to your vSphere environment. It not only serves as an authentication broker but also a token exchange, so what does this all mean you? In a nutshell this is a handshake.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
