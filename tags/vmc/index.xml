Customers can freely move workloads between multiple on-premises environments as well as VMware Cloud on AWS (VMC). During the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjYP2IuZK6k">VMworld US 2018 day 1 keynote&lt;/a> there were several demos shown, one included a data center evacuation using HCX (51:57). The data center evacuation was using a new HCX migration type called Cloud Motion with vSphere Replication. I’ll cover the HCX migration types in a later post. The workloads were being migrated from an on-premises data center to VMware Cloud on AWS (VMC). The big deal here is the impact during the migration to the users was NONE, ZIP, ZERO downtime. And there was also no replatforming of the workloads or applications.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Configuring Hybrid Linked Mode (HLM) for VMware Cloud on AWS</title><link>https://demo.gethugothemes.com/bookworm-light/blog/2017-10-26-configuring-hybrid-linked-mode-hlm-for-vmware-cloud-on-aws/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Oct 2017 06:30:45 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://demo.gethugothemes.com/bookworm-light/blog/2017-10-26-configuring-hybrid-linked-mode-hlm-for-vmware-cloud-on-aws/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hybrid Linked Mode (HLM) is a brand new feature available only for VMware Cloud on AWS (VMC), which was announced during VMworld US in August 2017. HLM provides the ability to extend an administrator’s management view from on-premises to VMC. This may sound oddly familiar if you are using Enhanced Linked Mode (ELM) in your on-premises environment. There are differences between ELM and HLM in their requirements, how they work, and what problem each is solving. William Lam has a post outlining the differences between the two features &lt;a href="https://www.virtuallyghetto.com/2017/09/enhanced-linked-mode-elm-vs-hybrid-linked-mode-hlm.html">here&lt;/a>. This post will go into detail on how to get HLM implemented.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
