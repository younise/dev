Google Cloud VMware Engine is &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/hybrid-cloud/google-cloud-vmware-engine-is-generally-available">now generally available&lt;/a> to all starting in US-east and US-west regions with plans to add eight more regions by the end of the year. When deployed, customers will receive a GCVE private cloud, which consists of ESXi Hosts, vCenter Server, vSAN, and NSX-T running on Google Cloud bare metal. Also included is VMware HCX, which allows customers to extend and migrate workloads from on-premises to GCVE and between GCVE private clouds.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
