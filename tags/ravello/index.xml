&lt;p>This blog post allows me to bring two of my favorite things together. I have been a fan of the vCenter Server Appliance (VCSA) since its release. With continuous improvements, it’s evident that VCSA is the future. My other favorite thing is &lt;span style="color: #0000ff;">&lt;strong>&lt;a href="http://www.ravellosystems.com">Ravello&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>&lt;/span>. They have given us the ability to have a home lab in the cloud, extend our current labs, and share blueprints. Two great products, that up to this point were not able to be used together. This is like having peanut butter on one slice and jelly on the other, and eating them individually.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>VMware Integrated OpenStack (VIO) SSO Error</title><link>https://emadyounis.com/dev/blog/2015-08-12-vmware-integrated-openstack-vio-sso-error/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Aug 2015 08:56:50 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://emadyounis.com/dev/blog/2015-08-12-vmware-integrated-openstack-vio-sso-error/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://emadyounis.com/assets/img/2015/08/SSO-with-VIO-Graphic.png?resize=309%2C217" alt="">Like other VMware products, VIO leverages Single Sign On (SSO). Luckily, the SSO configuration with VIO is fairly simple. When used with vSphere 5.5 it requires IP or FQDN of your vSphere SSO along with port 7444. With vSphere 6.0 you don’t have to use a port, it’s that easy. I ran into this error while installing VIO. Here is the process I went through.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Unsupported VMware Integrated OpenStack (VIO) Configuration</title><link>https://emadyounis.com/dev/blog/2015-07-15-unsupported-vmware-integrated-openstack-vio-configuration/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jul 2015 09:00:54 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://emadyounis.com/dev/blog/2015-07-15-unsupported-vmware-integrated-openstack-vio-configuration/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://emadyounis.com/assets/img/2015/07/VIO-Unsupported-Config1.jpg?resize=264%2C300" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In a perfect datacenter environment, we would all have an additional area for Dev/Test. This is not always the case and we don’t always have the resources readily available to us. Most of us get creative using what old equipment we have. Some carve out a section in their infrastructure, while others leverage the cloud. Currently I’ve been using &lt;span style="color: #0000ff;">&lt;strong>&lt;a href="http://www.ravellosystems.com/">Ravello&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>&lt;/span> as my Dev/Test area of my lab for VIO. A VIO production-ready deployment requires a significant amount of resources. These same resources may not be instantly available in some environments. The current deployment architecture of VIO requires 15 VMs with a total of 56CPUs and 192GB RAM; details can be found &lt;strong>&lt;span style="color: #0000ff;">&lt;a href="http://pubs.vmware.com/integrated-openstack-1/topic/com.vmware.ICbase/PDF/integrated-openstack-101-getting-started-guide.pdf">here&lt;/a>&lt;/span>&lt;/strong>. This doesn’t take into account if you’re using NSX. However, there are a few ways you can be conservative with VIO resources. Let me state up front: the following setup is not supported by VMware for production.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ravello Lab Setup for VMware Integrated OpenStack (VIO) Part 2</title><link>https://emadyounis.com/dev/blog/2015-06-26-ravello-lab-setup-for-vmware-integrated-openstack-vio-part-2/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Jun 2015 06:33:58 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://emadyounis.com/dev/blog/2015-06-26-ravello-lab-setup-for-vmware-integrated-openstack-vio-part-2/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://emadyounis.com/assets/img/2015/06/Ravello-with-VIO-Part-2.png?resize=300%2C113" alt="">Previously, we talked about the prerequisites (&lt;span style="color: #0000ff;">&lt;strong>&lt;a href="http://emadyounis.com/openstack/ravello-lab-setup-for-vmware-integrated-openstack-vio-part-1/">link&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>&lt;/span>) needed for a successful VIO deployment. Now that we’ve met them, let’s take things to the next level and deploy VIO.
