Google Cloud VMware Engine is &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/hybrid-cloud/google-cloud-vmware-engine-is-generally-available">now generally available&lt;/a> to all starting in US-east and US-west regions with plans to add eight more regions by the end of the year. When deployed, customers will receive a GCVE private cloud, which consists of ESXi Hosts, vCenter Server, vSAN, and NSX-T running on Google Cloud bare metal. Also included is VMware HCX, which allows customers to extend and migrate workloads from on-premises to GCVE and between GCVE private clouds.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>vCenter Server 6.7 What&amp;#8217;s New Rundown</title><link>https://emadyounis.com/dev/blog/2018-04-17-vcenter-server-6-7-whats-new-rundown/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Apr 2018 05:02:47 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://emadyounis.com/dev/blog/2018-04-17-vcenter-server-6-7-whats-new-rundown/</guid><description>&lt;p>Today VMware launched &lt;a href="http://vmw.re/vsphere67launch">vSphere 6.7&lt;/a> and there are lots of new enhancements in this release.

It gives me great pleasure to announce “&lt;a href="https://secure.vmware.com/45026_REG?touch=1&amp;amp;cid=70134000001SpfU">The Upgrading to VMware vSphere 6.5″ eBook&lt;/a>.

At the “Set up appliance VM” (step 5), the VCSA deployment and storage sizes are not available. The following error is received &lt;strong>“A problem occurred while reading the OVF file.. Error: ovftool is not available”&lt;/strong>. Let me start by saying this is &lt;strong>not&lt;/strong> an issue with the VCSA 6.5 ISO or installer, it has to do with a change in Sierra. Also, before I go any further, Sierra &lt;strong>is currently not supported&lt;/strong> with the VCSA 6.5 installer. Engineering is working to support Sierra in a future update. The supported system requirements for the VCSA installer are &lt;span style="color: #0000ff;">&lt;strong>&lt;a href="http://pubs.vmware.com/vsphere-65/index.jsp#com.vmware.vsphere.install.doc/GUID-BA4FA18C-1049-42AA-A5CD-DE863565251B.html#GUID-BA4FA18C-1049-42AA-A5CD-DE863565251B">here&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>&lt;/span>.

With lots of new features and updates, this is one of the biggest vSphere releases we have had in a while. Leading the charge is none other than the vCenter Server Appliance (VCSA). VMware’s direction for vCenter Server is the VCSA and it’s quite evident from this release. The VCSA and its Windows counterpart remain on par when it comes to scalability. From an operational and feature perspective, the VCSA has advantages. This post is a quick rundown of the VCSA 6.5, I’ll go into more details in future blog posts.

&lt;p>This blog post allows me to bring two of my favorite things together. I have been a fan of the vCenter Server Appliance (VCSA) since its release. With continuous improvements, it’s evident that VCSA is the future. My other favorite thing is &lt;span style="color: #0000ff;">&lt;strong>&lt;a href="http://www.ravellosystems.com">Ravello&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>&lt;/span>. They have given us the ability to have a home lab in the cloud, extend our current labs, and share blueprints. Two great products, that up to this point were not able to be used together. This is like having peanut butter on one slice and jelly on the other, and eating them individually.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>vCenter Server Appliance (VCSA) 6.0 Update 1 Rundown</title><link>https://emadyounis.com/dev/blog/2015-09-14-vcenter-server-appliance-vcsa-6-0-update-1-rundown/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Sep 2015 08:57:33 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://emadyounis.com/dev/blog/2015-09-14-vcenter-server-appliance-vcsa-6-0-update-1-rundown/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;span style="color: #000000;">&lt;img src="https://emadyounis.com/assets/img/2015/09/VCSA-Update-1-Main-Image.png?resize=219%2C119" alt="VCSA Update 1 - Main Image">VMworld 2015 has come and gone, at least the US version.

&lt;p>In a perfect datacenter environment, we would all have an additional area for Dev/Test. This is not always the case and we don’t always have the resources readily available to us. Most of us get creative using what old equipment we have. Some carve out a section in their infrastructure, while others leverage the cloud. Currently I’ve been using &lt;span style="color: #0000ff;">&lt;strong>&lt;a href="http://www.ravellosystems.com/">Ravello&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>&lt;/span> as my Dev/Test area of my lab for VIO. A VIO production-ready deployment requires a significant amount of resources. These same resources may not be instantly available in some environments. The current deployment architecture of VIO requires 15 VMs with a total of 56CPUs and 192GB RAM; details can be found &lt;strong>&lt;span style="color: #0000ff;">&lt;a href="http://pubs.vmware.com/integrated-openstack-1/topic/com.vmware.ICbase/PDF/integrated-openstack-101-getting-started-guide.pdf">here&lt;/a>&lt;/span>&lt;/strong>. This doesn’t take into account if you’re using NSX. However, there are a few ways you can be conservative with VIO resources.

One of the requirements is to leverage your current VMware infrastructure. Of course your plate is already full, and now you need to learn a new platform. Here are a few things that should ease your mind when considering OpenStack. First, OpenStack is a framework that can use your current hardware and software infrastructure. Second, OpenStack services allow integration at the software layer with vendors like VMware. Finally, OpenStack uses drivers to translate requests to calls on the software infrastructure. Why is this important? Let’s take a look at VMware Integrated OpenStack (VIO) to answer these questions.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>vCenter Appliance (VCSA) 6.0 Scripted Install</title><link>https://emadyounis.com/dev/blog/2015-03-24-vcenter-appliance-vcsa-6-0-scripted-install/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Mar 2015 15:10:36 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://emadyounis.com/dev/blog/2015-03-24-vcenter-appliance-vcsa-6-0-scripted-install/</guid><description>&lt;p>The VCSA 6.0 has two deployment types, guided and scripted.

&lt;p>It’s that time again, a new release of vSphere is upon us. Some features we’ve been waiting for a while now, others are new or revamped.
