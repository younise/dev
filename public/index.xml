      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #ff0000;&#34;&gt;Updated 3/18/21 to include changes to the service&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-preserver-spaces=&#34;true&#34;&gt;The general availability (GA) for the next evolution of Azure VMware Solution (AVS) was announced &lt;del&gt;yesterday&lt;/del&gt; during the &lt;a href=&#34;https://news.microsoft.com/ignite-2020-book-of-news/#158-next-generation-azure-vmware-solution-now-generally-available&#34;&gt;Microsoft Ignite 2020&lt;/a&gt; virtual conference. This is a joint partnership between Microsoft and VMware, where Azure VMware Solution is a Microsoft managed service built on Azure bare metal infrastructure and cloud verified by VMware. The initial launch of the Azure VMware Solution in May of 2019 was by CloudSimple; this latest release is built and architected by Microsoft, providing an integrated experience with Azure services. Azure VMware Solution is currently available in the following 10 regions: East US, North Central US, West US, UK South, Japan East, West Europe, North Europe, Canada Central, Australia East, and Southeast Asia. More regions will be available in the future; additional details can be found by searching the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/global-infrastructure/services/?products=azure-vmware&amp;amp;regions=all&#34;&gt;&lt;span data-preserver-spaces=&#34;true&#34;&gt;Microsoft Products available by region page&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span data-preserver-spaces=&#34;true&#34;&gt;. Customers running the CloudSimple Azure VMware Solution version also have a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-vmware/faq&#34;&gt;&lt;span data-preserver-spaces=&#34;true&#34;&gt;migration path to this latest release&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span data-preserver-spaces=&#34;true&#34;&gt;, leveraging VMware HCX.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last month &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/hybrid-cloud/announcing-google-cloud-vmware-engine&#34;&gt;Google announced&lt;/a&gt; a first-party and fully managed solution called Google Cloud VMware Engine (GCVE), which was in limited early access since January 2020. Google Cloud VMware Engine is &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/hybrid-cloud/google-cloud-vmware-engine-is-generally-available&#34;&gt;now generally available&lt;/a&gt; to all starting in US-east and US-west regions with plans to add eight more regions by the end of the year. When deployed, customers will receive a GCVE private cloud, which consists of ESXi Hosts, vCenter Server, vSAN, and NSX-T running on Google Cloud bare metal. Also included is VMware HCX, which allows customers to extend and migrate workloads from on-premises to GCVE and between GCVE private clouds.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve received several questions lately on what happens to a VM’s Managed Object Reference (MoRef) ID and InstanceUUID when it’s migrated across different vCenter Servers using VMware HCX. This information is essential for anything being used to identify VMs, such as provisioning systems, CMDBs, ticketing systems, and backup solutions are examples of tooling using this information.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Time is truly precious. With a blink of an eye, the years seem to be flying by, which makes it hard to believe in about another month marks four years at VMware for me. Its been a place with no shortage of learning and growing opportunities. I also feel incredibly blessed to have gotten the chance to work and collaborate with so many talented folks across the different business units within VMware.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>vCenter Server 6.7 Update 1 Convergence Tool</title>
      <link>http://localhost:52725/bookworm-light/blog/2018-10-22-vcenter-server-6-7-update-1-convergence-tool/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The embedded deployment is now VMware’s recommended deployment model for vCenter Server. This means all the required vCenter Server services are running on the same node. The release of &lt;a href=&#34;http://emadyounis.com/whats-new-in-vcenter-server-6-7-update-1/&#34;&gt;vSphere 6.7 Update 1 introduces the convergence CLI tool&lt;/a&gt;. Customers with an existing external deployment can now change their topology to embedded. This deployment model also supports Enhanced Linked Mode (ELM). In the past, an external Platform Services Controller (PSC) was only needed for ELM. This is no longer the case with a simplified deployment model. While we are on the subject, let me clear up a few misconceptions I’ve seen about embedded deployments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I’m happy to announce &lt;a href=&#34;https://my.vmware.com/en/web/vmware/info/slug/datacenter_cloud_infrastructure/vmware_vsphere/6_7&#34;&gt;vSphere 6.7 Update 1&lt;/a&gt; is now generally available. This release includes a single vSphere Client to manage them all. I’m referring to the HTML5 based vSphere Client, now fully featured. Also, included in this release are the necessary tools for convergence and repointing. An external Platform Services Controller (PSC) for enhanced linked mode is a thing of the past. Customers can now convert to a simplified embedded deployment supporting the same functionality.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently attended a cloud migration session. The first thing the speaker said was “we want you to migrate to the Cloud, but we don’t care how you do it”. There was no discussion of service level agreements (SLA), dependencies, or migration options, only get to the cloud! Before migrating any workload, it’s important to have a good understanding of its SLAs, dependencies, and data. Once you have a good grasp of the workload, the next step is selecting the right migration tool or type. The following is in no particular order, but here are a few things to consider before starting a migration:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://hcx.vmware.com/#/home&#34;&gt;Hybrid Cloud Extension (HCX)&lt;/a&gt; is an all in one solution for workload mobility. Customers can freely move workloads between multiple on-premises environments as well as VMware Cloud on AWS (VMC). During the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjYP2IuZK6k&#34;&gt;VMworld US 2018 day 1 keynote&lt;/a&gt; there were several demos shown, one included a data center evacuation using HCX (51:57). The data center evacuation was using a new HCX migration type called Cloud Motion with vSphere Replication. I’ll cover the HCX migration types in a later post. The workloads were being migrated from an on-premises data center to VMware Cloud on AWS (VMC). The big deal here is the impact during the migration to the users was NONE, ZIP, ZERO downtime. And there was also no replatforming of the workloads or applications.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Stretched Clusters for VMware Cloud on AWS &amp;#8211; Overview</title>
      <link>http://localhost:52725/bookworm-light/blog/2018-05-14-stretched-clusters-overview/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;VMware Cloud on AWS includes resiliency at different layers. We are all familiar with vSphere HA protecting against ESXi host failures. With VMware Cloud on AWS, ESXi hosts reside in an AWS availability zone and are protected by vSphere HA. What about protection for the availability zone the ESXi hosts reside in? While an AWS availability zone failure is a rare occurrence, customers should know they also are protected at this layer as well. A new feature called &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.vmware.com/vmc-aws/roadmap&#34;&gt;Stretched Clusters&lt;/a&gt; for VMware Cloud on AWS is designed to protect against an AWS availability zone failure. Now applications can span multiple AWS availability zones within a VMware Cloud on AWS cluster. If an application instance fails the second instance in another availability zone can take over. This, of course, depends on if the application includes this level of availability. Let’s take a look at the Stretched Clusters feature.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With the release of &lt;a href=&#34;http://emadyounis.com/vcenter/vcenter-server-6-7-whats-new-rundown/&#34;&gt;vSphere 6.7&lt;/a&gt; and 6.5 U2 comes architectural changes for vCenter Server. vCenter Server is going back to its roots of a simplified deployment model. vCenter Server used to be a single node deployment. The only debate was about its availability. Over time the architecture of vCenter Server has changed introducing a distributed deployment model. Core services like inventory, web client, SSO, and vCenter could run on separate nodes. vCenter Server had the potential of becoming six nodes in this model when adding the VCDB and VUM. The distributed deployment model became too complex for management, maintenance, and upgrades.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today VMware launched &lt;a href=&#34;http://vmw.re/vsphere67launch&#34;&gt;vSphere 6.7&lt;/a&gt; and there are lots of new enhancements in this release. But first the news. This is the final release for both vCenter Server for Windows and the vSphere Web Client (flash). The vCenter Server path is set and has been for a while with the vCenter Server Appliance (VCSA). The vSphere Client (HTLM5) is getting close to feature complete in this release.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the past year I have written several blog posts and conducted workshops on vSphere 6.5 upgrades. The intent was to help customers learn about the upgrade concepts and planning. Only by getting familiar with the concepts and planning accordingly will the execution be successful. Part of the upgrade journey is knowing what resources are available, where to find them, and how to use them . It gives me great pleasure to announce “&lt;a href=&#34;https://secure.vmware.com/45026_REG?touch=1&amp;amp;cid=70134000001SpfU&#34;&gt;The Upgrading to VMware vSphere 6.5″ eBook&lt;/a&gt;. This is a new and free resource to help guide VMware customers with all stages of the vSphere 6.5 upgrade process. Let’s take a look on what’s included inside this new resource and help you impress your management and colleagues with your vSphere upgrade knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hybrid Linked Mode (HLM) is a brand new feature available only for VMware Cloud on AWS (VMC), which was announced during VMworld US in August 2017. HLM provides the ability to extend an administrator’s management view from on-premises to VMC. This may sound oddly familiar if you are using Enhanced Linked Mode (ELM) in your on-premises environment. There are differences between ELM and HLM in their requirements, how they work, and what problem each is solving. William Lam has a post outlining the differences between the two features &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.virtuallyghetto.com/2017/09/enhanced-linked-mode-elm-vs-hybrid-linked-mode-hlm.html&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. This post will go into detail on how to get HLM implemented.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

We now have officially supported Migration Tools in &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #3366ff;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://blogs.vmware.com/vsphere/2016/09/vcenter-server-migration-tool-vsphere-6-0-update-2m.html&#34;&gt;vSphere 6.0 U2m&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and vSphere 6.5. With the release of vSphere 6.5, the VCSA has surpassed its Windows counterpart in terms of &lt;a href=&#34;http://emadyounis.com/vcenter/vcenter-server-appliance-vcsa-6-5-whats-new-rundown/&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #3366ff;&#34;&gt;features and performance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Then there was the hot swag that debuted at both VMworld US and Barcelona, in the form of stickers and shirts. Yes, there were hoodies too 🙂&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, some macOS Sierra users have had an issue with the VCSA 6.5 installer. At the “Set up appliance VM” (step 5), the VCSA deployment and storage sizes are not available. The following error is received &lt;strong&gt;“A problem occurred while reading the OVF file.. Error: ovftool is not available”&lt;/strong&gt;. Let me start by saying this is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; an issue with the VCSA 6.5 ISO or installer, it has to do with a change in Sierra. Also, before I go any further, Sierra &lt;strong&gt;is currently not supported&lt;/strong&gt; with the VCSA 6.5 installer. Engineering is working to support Sierra in a future update. The supported system requirements for the VCSA installer are &lt;span style=&#34;color: #0000ff;&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://pubs.vmware.com/vsphere-65/index.jsp#com.vmware.vsphere.install.doc/GUID-BA4FA18C-1049-42AA-A5CD-DE863565251B.html#GUID-BA4FA18C-1049-42AA-A5CD-DE863565251B&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. With that said, I want to shed more light on why this is happening and what options are available with Sierra.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The vCenter Server Appliance (VCSA) 6.5 has significant new features and improvements mentioned &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://emadyounis.com/vcenter/vcenter-server-appliance-vcsa-6-5-whats-new-rundown/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. One area of notice is the installer, which in this release not only has a new look and feel but other improvements. These improvements are not only visible from the ISO, but also during the deployment. The end result is a better experience throughout the VCSA deployment process. Let’s jump in and take a closer look.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;During VMworld Barcelona 2016, VMware announced vSphere 6.5. With lots of new features and updates, this is one of the biggest vSphere releases we have had in a while. Leading the charge is none other than the vCenter Server Appliance (VCSA). VMware’s direction for vCenter Server is the VCSA and it’s quite evident from this release. The VCSA and its Windows counterpart remain on par when it comes to scalability. From an operational and feature perspective, the VCSA has advantages. This post is a quick rundown of the VCSA 6.5, I’ll go into more details in future blog posts. Time to take a look at what’s new and why migrate2vcsa you should 🙂&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Since then there has already been an &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #3366ff;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://labs.vmware.com/flings/vsphere-html5-web-client&#34;&gt;update to the Fling&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. I’ve gone through update process in my lab using the rpm, but I also decided to deploy a new OVA (version 1.1) and found a few hidden features.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The vSphere Web Client would be the future management tool replacing the vSphere client aka “Legacy, Thick or C# Client”. This would be become more evident over time with each release of vSphere. New features could only be managed through the vSphere Web Client. While the concept of a browser based client is a step in the right direction, the dependency of flash was not. Keep in mind the decision to use flash was made when it was the standard for web applications, times and standards have changed. With that change it has taken some time to work on replatforming the vSphere Web Client. This always leads to the question, when will we see a HTML5 version of the Web Client? I’m happy to announce the wait is over!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A New Year not only represents a new calendar year, for many it also symbolizes a time of change. Reassessing what’s going on in their lives and what change, if any do they want to introduce. It’s usually the most common time for new job opportunities or changes to occur. Recently several members in the community have made some significant moves. Anything from different companies, geographic locations, roles, and others just taking a sabbatical. While these types of job changes aren’t easy, they’re needed to get us to the next step of our journey.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I have been a fan of the vCenter Server Appliance (VCSA) since its release. With continuous improvements, it’s evident that VCSA is the future. My other favorite thing is &lt;span style=&#34;color: #0000ff;&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ravellosystems.com&#34;&gt;Ravello&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. They have given us the ability to have a home lab in the cloud, extend our current labs, and share blueprints. Two great products, that up to this point were not able to be used together. This is like having peanut butter on one slice and jelly on the other, and eating them individually.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Luckily, the SSO configuration with VIO is fairly simple. When used with vSphere 5.5 it requires IP or FQDN of your vSphere SSO along with port 7444. With vSphere 6.0 you don’t have to use a port, it’s that easy. I ran into this error while installing VIO. Here is the process I went through.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Unsupported VMware Integrated OpenStack (VIO) Configuration</title>

This is not always the case and we don’t always have the resources readily available to us. Most of us get creative using what old equipment we have. Some carve out a section in their infrastructure, while others leverage the cloud. Currently I’ve been using &lt;span style=&#34;color: #0000ff;&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ravellosystems.com/&#34;&gt;Ravello&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; as my Dev/Test area of my lab for VIO. A VIO production-ready deployment requires a significant amount of resources. These same resources may not be instantly available in some environments. The current deployment architecture of VIO requires 15 VMs with a total of 56CPUs and 192GB RAM; details can be found &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #0000ff;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://pubs.vmware.com/integrated-openstack-1/topic/com.vmware.ICbase/PDF/integrated-openstack-101-getting-started-guide.pdf&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. This doesn’t take into account if you’re using NSX. However, there are a few ways you can be conservative with VIO resources. Let me state up front: the following setup is not supported by VMware for production.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Now that we’ve met them, let’s take things to the next level and deploy VIO. VIO is available at no cost to those who have purchased the following VMware licensing:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

One of the requirements is to leverage your current VMware infrastructure. Of course your plate is already full, and now you need to learn a new platform. Here are a few things that should ease your mind when considering OpenStack. First, OpenStack is a framework that can use your current hardware and software infrastructure. Second, OpenStack services allow integration at the software layer with vendors like VMware. Finally, OpenStack uses drivers to translate requests to calls on the software infrastructure. Why is this important? Let’s take a look at VMware Integrated OpenStack (VIO) to answer these questions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Think of the possibilities with the ability to move forward or backwards in time. There even is the idea of an alternate universe. The concept of time travel is so huge that we have several books, TV shows, and movies based on it. If only we had a time machine, like in Back to the Future! The latest release of Tintri’s OS 3.2 includes several new features. SyncVM is one them. The new SyncVM feature lets you experience time travel via your VMs. SyncVM leverages snapshot capabilities to move back and forth in time. This can be at the VM level. SyncVM also lets you propagate changes at a vDisk level from one VM to a set of VMs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;VCP6-DCV is now ready to be taken, well sort of. The exam is in beta and requires authorization. The other thing that I noticed is there is currently no blueprint to download. Instead there are tabs labeled: &lt;strong&gt;Exam Topics&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;How to Prepare&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;Additional Resources&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;During my career I have had the opportunity to work as both a customer and partner. As a customer I worked for large enterprise environments. I did design, implementation, and troubleshooting. This was great but was all done within a silo, with a limited scope. When I went to work for a partner things changed. I got to see different environments and had to develop a different mind set. I got exposure and access to tools and portals that I wouldn’t have as a customer. Also there was more focus on learning and training. In each role I developed new skills and grew. I also had the opportunity to work and learn from a lot of amazing people.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The VCSA 6.0 has two deployment types, guided and scripted. The scripted deployment is now simplified. You are now provided several templates, 5 to be exact. Now You don’t have to just use the default templates you can add to them or even create your own. Getting started is not that hard; once all the necessary information is available. The templates are usable from a command prompt or PowerShell. Let’s walk through how to use both.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

For a nice overview of the install process, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/mwVme&#34;&gt;Michael White&lt;/a&gt; has a great &lt;a href=&#34;http://notesfrommwhite.net/2015/02/14/getting-opvizor-working-and-is-it-interesting-or-what/&#34;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;. There really isn’t much to the setup at all, and it is quick and easy to get up and running. Once the setup is complete, the dashboard with your VMware infrastructure info is available. &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/rogerlund&#34;&gt;Roger Lund&lt;/a&gt; navigates through the dashboard components in this &lt;a href=&#34;http://vbrainstorm.com/opvizor-inside-the-dashboard/&#34;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are two industry standards when it comes to duplication. The first type is Inline which occurs as data is being written. Second is Post-Process where data is analyzed after being written. So what’s the difference to using one over the other?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Some features we’ve been waiting for a while now, others are new or revamped. It’s evident that VMware has put effort into the vCenter appliance. In previous releases it was lacking several features needed to make it equal to its Windows Counterpart. Well it seems that VMware has heard the many cries, and the appliance is now, in my opinion, ready for prime time. Let’s take a look at what’s new and you decide if you will be a vCenter 6.0 appliance adopter.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Their approach is private clouds should be simple without the worry of large IT staffs and ROI. Their solution is delivered onto your existing infrastructure using a SaaS managed approached to OpenStack. Of course; as you read this and think no way can a private cloud utilizing OpenStack be simple. Well tell that to the folks at Platform9, because they’re doing it. Here are 10 reasons to consider:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In a previous post, we created a &lt;a href=&#34;http://emadyounis.com/vmware/windows-repository-for-appliance-updates/&#34; title=&#34;Windows Repository for Offline Appliance Updates&#34;&gt;Windows Server repository &lt;/a&gt;for updates. This repository will serve to upgrade both the Identity Appliance and vRA Appliance(s). Before upgrading we need to ensure backups are in place. I know I’m preaching to the choir, but still need to stress the importance. We are not short of ways to backup the environment using VM snapshots (temporarily) and vSphere data protection to name a few. For SQL using a maintenance plan is also an option. The success of the upgrade relies on following the correct order. The steps below follow a simple deployment model but I will try to add areas where a distributed model differs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;To take advantage of the new features that vRA 6.2 has to offer, it’s time to upgrade. The upgrade will make it easier to transition from the vCAC branding to vRA. This was also a good time to start thinking about how to go about the process.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;IaaS is the component that allows the creation of blueprints and provisioning to endpoints. It also handles machine life cycle, governance, and decommissioning to name a few. IaaS also has some muscle behind it in regards to extensibility. Before getting too far in this discussion, let’s go through the IaaS installation process.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The stage is now set for January 14-16 &lt;a href=&#34;http://techfieldday.com/event/vfd4/&#34;&gt;Tech Field Day – Virtualization Field Day 4&lt;/a&gt;. I’m honored and pleased to announce that I’ve been invited to attend the event, which will take place in Austin, Texas. The Tech Field Day events allow IT vendors an opportunity to present on products and independent thought leaders to discuss and share opinions. Who makes up these independent thought leaders you ask? The selected delegates come from various independent backgrounds such as authors, bloggers, speakers and podcasters. The key word here is independent; in order for you to participate as a delegate you can’t currently work for a vendor. For more information about the delegates and selection process check out the following &lt;a href=&#34;http://techfieldday.com/delegates/become-field-day-delegate/&#34;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently we discussed &lt;a href=&#34;http://emadyounis.com/vrealize-automation/vrealize-automation-6-1-formally-vcac-iaas-database/&#34; title=&#34;vRealize Automation 6.1 (formally vCAC) – IaaS Database&#34;&gt;how to setup the IaaS database&lt;/a&gt;. Did you know there are scripts available to do the IaaS database install? There is a catch to using the scripts to pre-create the IaaS database, anyone? anyone? A pre-created IaaS database will only work with the custom install (distributed) for the IaaS Server. This supports the two scripted methods, but more on that later.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Up to this point we had the convenience of deploying appliances for both &lt;a href=&#34;http://emadyounis.com/vrealize-automation/vrealize-automation-6-1-formally-vcloud-automation-center-identity-appliance-deployment-configuration/&#34; title=&#34;vRealize Automation 6.1 (formally vCloud Automation Center) – Identity Appliance – Deployment / Configuration&#34;&gt;SSO&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href=&#34;http://emadyounis.com/vrealize-automation/vrealize-automation-6-1-formally-vcac-vra-appliance-deployment-configuration/&#34; title=&#34;vRealize Automation 6.1 (formally vCAC) – vRA Appliance Deployment &amp;amp; Configuration&#34;&gt;vRA&lt;/a&gt;. The deployment of the Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) requires Microsoft Windows &amp;amp; SQL. IaaS uses Microsoft SQL to maintain information about managed virtual machines and policies. Microsoft SQL can either be a remote server deployment or local with IaaS. So before we can setup IaaS we need to have SQL installed, let’s get started.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;At this point we have deployed &amp;amp; configured SSO, of course with HA and backups in mind. The next piece is the vRealize Automation appliance (vRA). The vRA appliance provides cloud management &amp;amp; a self-service portal for vRA. We are now going walk through the deployment and configuration of the appliance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&#34;http://emadyounis.com/vrealize-automation/vrealize-automation-6-1-formally-vcloud-automation-center-identity-appliance-deployment-configuration/&#34; title=&#34;vRealize Automation 6.1 (formally vCloud Automation Center) – Identity Appliance – Deployment / Configuration&#34;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;, we discussed the importance of SSO as it relates to vRA (vRealize Automation). We also demonstrated how to deploy &amp;amp; configure the vRA identity appliance. Due to the nature of the identity appliance we need to make sure that SSO is in a high available state. There currently is no native HA feature built in, so what are our options for protecting the identity appliance you ask? Here are some options:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The introduction of Single Sign On (SSO) in vSphere 5.1 has provided a new major dependency of the infrastructure. SSO provides a secure way of authenticating to your vSphere environment. It not only serves as an authentication broker but also a token exchange, so what does this all mean you? In a nutshell this is a handshake.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Of course remember what happens in Vegas, goes on twitter #VeeamON. The conference was filled with lots of activities such as lab warz, tour of the modern datacenter and training for the Veeam Certified Engineer (VMCE) just to name a few. Although three days, well four for those who attended the VMCE training, the agenda was quite full:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Simulators can be very useful tools to learn most of a products features. They can also serve as test platforms for updates, scripts, migrations, etc without the fear of affecting your production environment and causing a resume generating event. NetApp simulates its Data ONTAP software allowing for support for a majority of its functionality within a virtual environment. Supported VMware environments consists of Workstation, Player, Fusion and vSphere. This install process covers deploying the Data ONTAP simulator in cluster mode on a vSphere 5.5 lab environment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
