      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last month &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/hybrid-cloud/announcing-google-cloud-vmware-engine&#34;&gt;Google announced&lt;/a&gt; a first-party and fully managed solution called Google Cloud VMware Engine (GCVE), which was in limited early access since January 2020. Google Cloud VMware Engine is &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/hybrid-cloud/google-cloud-vmware-engine-is-generally-available&#34;&gt;now generally available&lt;/a&gt; to all starting in US-east and US-west regions with plans to add eight more regions by the end of the year. When deployed, customers will receive a GCVE private cloud, which consists of ESXi Hosts, vCenter Server, vSAN, and NSX-T running on Google Cloud bare metal. Also included is VMware HCX, which allows customers to extend and migrate workloads from on-premises to GCVE and between GCVE private clouds.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today VMware launched &lt;a href=&#34;http://vmw.re/vsphere67launch&#34;&gt;vSphere 6.7&lt;/a&gt; and there are lots of new enhancements in this release. But first the news. This is the final release for both vCenter Server for Windows and the vSphere Web Client (flash). The vCenter Server path is set and has been for a while with the vCenter Server Appliance (VCSA). The vSphere Client (HTLM5) is getting close to feature complete in this release.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the past year I have written several blog posts and conducted workshops on vSphere 6.5 upgrades. The intent was to help customers learn about the upgrade concepts and planning. Only by getting familiar with the concepts and planning accordingly will the execution be successful. Part of the upgrade journey is knowing what resources are available, where to find them, and how to use them . It gives me great pleasure to announce “&lt;a href=&#34;https://secure.vmware.com/45026_REG?touch=1&amp;amp;cid=70134000001SpfU&#34;&gt;The Upgrading to VMware vSphere 6.5″ eBook&lt;/a&gt;. This is a new and free resource to help guide VMware customers with all stages of the vSphere 6.5 upgrade process. Let’s take a look on what’s included inside this new resource and help you impress your management and colleagues with your vSphere upgrade knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>vCenter Server Appliance (VCSA) 6.5 Installer macOS Ovftool Error</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, some macOS Sierra users have had an issue with the VCSA 6.5 installer. At the “Set up appliance VM” (step 5), the VCSA deployment and storage sizes are not available. The following error is received &lt;strong&gt;“A problem occurred while reading the OVF file.. Error: ovftool is not available”&lt;/strong&gt;. Let me start by saying this is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; an issue with the VCSA 6.5 ISO or installer, it has to do with a change in Sierra. Also, before I go any further, Sierra &lt;strong&gt;is currently not supported&lt;/strong&gt; with the VCSA 6.5 installer. Engineering is working to support Sierra in a future update. The supported system requirements for the VCSA installer are &lt;span style=&#34;color: #0000ff;&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://pubs.vmware.com/vsphere-65/index.jsp#com.vmware.vsphere.install.doc/GUID-BA4FA18C-1049-42AA-A5CD-DE863565251B.html#GUID-BA4FA18C-1049-42AA-A5CD-DE863565251B&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. With that said, I want to shed more light on why this is happening and what options are available with Sierra.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The vCenter Server Appliance (VCSA) 6.5 has significant new features and improvements mentioned &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://emadyounis.com/vcenter/vcenter-server-appliance-vcsa-6-5-whats-new-rundown/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. One area of notice is the installer, which in this release not only has a new look and feel but other improvements. These improvements are not only visible from the ISO, but also during the deployment. The end result is a better experience throughout the VCSA deployment process. Let’s jump in and take a closer look.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;During VMworld Barcelona 2016, VMware announced vSphere 6.5. With lots of new features and updates, this is one of the biggest vSphere releases we have had in a while. Leading the charge is none other than the vCenter Server Appliance (VCSA). VMware’s direction for vCenter Server is the VCSA and it’s quite evident from this release. The VCSA and its Windows counterpart remain on par when it comes to scalability. From an operational and feature perspective, the VCSA has advantages. This post is a quick rundown of the VCSA 6.5, I’ll go into more details in future blog posts. Time to take a look at what’s new and why migrate2vcsa you should 🙂&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I have been a fan of the vCenter Server Appliance (VCSA) since its release. With continuous improvements, it’s evident that VCSA is the future. My other favorite thing is &lt;span style=&#34;color: #0000ff;&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ravellosystems.com&#34;&gt;Ravello&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. They have given us the ability to have a home lab in the cloud, extend our current labs, and share blueprints. Two great products, that up to this point were not able to be used together. This is like having peanut butter on one slice and jelly on the other, and eating them individually.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

There were several sessions giving love to vCenter. This included the vCenter Server Appliance (VCSA). Here are a few of the sessions that are worth a look.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>VMware Integrated OpenStack (VIO) SSO Error</title>

Luckily, the SSO configuration with VIO is fairly simple. When used with vSphere 5.5 it requires IP or FQDN of your vSphere SSO along with port 7444. With vSphere 6.0 you don’t have to use a port, it’s that easy. I ran into this error while installing VIO. Here is the process I went through.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Unsupported VMware Integrated OpenStack (VIO) Configuration</title>

This is not always the case and we don’t always have the resources readily available to us. Most of us get creative using what old equipment we have. Some carve out a section in their infrastructure, while others leverage the cloud. Currently I’ve been using &lt;span style=&#34;color: #0000ff;&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ravellosystems.com/&#34;&gt;Ravello&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; as my Dev/Test area of my lab for VIO. A VIO production-ready deployment requires a significant amount of resources. These same resources may not be instantly available in some environments. The current deployment architecture of VIO requires 15 VMs with a total of 56CPUs and 192GB RAM; details can be found &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #0000ff;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://pubs.vmware.com/integrated-openstack-1/topic/com.vmware.ICbase/PDF/integrated-openstack-101-getting-started-guide.pdf&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. This doesn’t take into account if you’re using NSX. However, there are a few ways you can be conservative with VIO resources. Let me state up front: the following setup is not supported by VMware for production.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Now that we’ve met them, let’s take things to the next level and deploy VIO. VIO is available at no cost to those who have purchased the following VMware licensing:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

One of the requirements is to leverage your current VMware infrastructure. Of course your plate is already full, and now you need to learn a new platform. Here are a few things that should ease your mind when considering OpenStack. First, OpenStack is a framework that can use your current hardware and software infrastructure. Second, OpenStack services allow integration at the software layer with vendors like VMware. Finally, OpenStack uses drivers to translate requests to calls on the software infrastructure. Why is this important? Let’s take a look at VMware Integrated OpenStack (VIO) to answer these questions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The VCSA 6.0 has two deployment types, guided and scripted. The scripted deployment is now simplified. You are now provided several templates, 5 to be exact. Now You don’t have to just use the default templates you can add to them or even create your own. Getting started is not that hard; once all the necessary information is available. The templates are usable from a command prompt or PowerShell. Let’s walk through how to use both.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently received my vExpert NFR license from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.opvizor.com/&#34;&gt;Opvizor&lt;/a&gt; to try their health analyzer tool. For a nice overview of the install process, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/mwVme&#34;&gt;Michael White&lt;/a&gt; has a great &lt;a href=&#34;http://notesfrommwhite.net/2015/02/14/getting-opvizor-working-and-is-it-interesting-or-what/&#34;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;. There really isn’t much to the setup at all, and it is quick and easy to get up and running. Once the setup is complete, the dashboard with your VMware infrastructure info is available. &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/rogerlund&#34;&gt;Roger Lund&lt;/a&gt; navigates through the dashboard components in this &lt;a href=&#34;http://vbrainstorm.com/opvizor-inside-the-dashboard/&#34;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;. What I’m really looking to focus on are Opvizor’s reporting capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Some features we’ve been waiting for a while now, others are new or revamped. It’s evident that VMware has put effort into the vCenter appliance. In previous releases it was lacking several features needed to make it equal to its Windows Counterpart. Well it seems that VMware has heard the many cries, and the appliance is now, in my opinion, ready for prime time. Let’s take a look at what’s new and you decide if you will be a vCenter 6.0 appliance adopter.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;To take advantage of the new features that vRA 6.2 has to offer, it’s time to upgrade. The upgrade will make it easier to transition from the vCAC branding to vRA. This was also a good time to start thinking about how to go about the process.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;IaaS is the component that allows the creation of blueprints and provisioning to endpoints. It also handles machine life cycle, governance, and decommissioning to name a few. IaaS also has some muscle behind it in regards to extensibility. Before getting too far in this discussion, let’s go through the IaaS installation process.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently we discussed &lt;a href=&#34;http://emadyounis.com/vrealize-automation/vrealize-automation-6-1-formally-vcac-iaas-database/&#34; title=&#34;vRealize Automation 6.1 (formally vCAC) – IaaS Database&#34;&gt;how to setup the IaaS database&lt;/a&gt;. Did you know there are scripts available to do the IaaS database install? There is a catch to using the scripts to pre-create the IaaS database, anyone? anyone? A pre-created IaaS database will only work with the custom install (distributed) for the IaaS Server. This supports the two scripted methods, but more on that later.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Up to this point we had the convenience of deploying appliances for both &lt;a href=&#34;http://emadyounis.com/vrealize-automation/vrealize-automation-6-1-formally-vcloud-automation-center-identity-appliance-deployment-configuration/&#34; title=&#34;vRealize Automation 6.1 (formally vCloud Automation Center) – Identity Appliance – Deployment / Configuration&#34;&gt;SSO&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href=&#34;http://emadyounis.com/vrealize-automation/vrealize-automation-6-1-formally-vcac-vra-appliance-deployment-configuration/&#34; title=&#34;vRealize Automation 6.1 (formally vCAC) – vRA Appliance Deployment &amp;amp; Configuration&#34;&gt;vRA&lt;/a&gt;. The deployment of the Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) requires Microsoft Windows &amp;amp; SQL. IaaS uses Microsoft SQL to maintain information about managed virtual machines and policies. Microsoft SQL can either be a remote server deployment or local with IaaS. So before we can setup IaaS we need to have SQL installed, let’s get started.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;At this point we have deployed &amp;amp; configured SSO, of course with HA and backups in mind. The next piece is the vRealize Automation appliance (vRA). The vRA appliance provides cloud management &amp;amp; a self-service portal for vRA. We are now going walk through the deployment and configuration of the appliance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&#34;http://emadyounis.com/vrealize-automation/vrealize-automation-6-1-formally-vcloud-automation-center-identity-appliance-deployment-configuration/&#34; title=&#34;vRealize Automation 6.1 (formally vCloud Automation Center) – Identity Appliance – Deployment / Configuration&#34;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;, we discussed the importance of SSO as it relates to vRA (vRealize Automation). We also demonstrated how to deploy &amp;amp; configure the vRA identity appliance. Due to the nature of the identity appliance we need to make sure that SSO is in a high available state. There currently is no native HA feature built in, so what are our options for protecting the identity appliance you ask? Here are some options:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The introduction of Single Sign On (SSO) in vSphere 5.1 has provided a new major dependency of the infrastructure. SSO provides a secure way of authenticating to your vSphere environment. It not only serves as an authentication broker but also a token exchange, so what does this all mean you? In a nutshell this is a handshake.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
