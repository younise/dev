      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, some macOS Sierra users have had an issue with the VCSA 6.5 installer. At the “Set up appliance VM” (step 5), the VCSA deployment and storage sizes are not available. The following error is received &lt;strong&gt;“A problem occurred while reading the OVF file.. Error: ovftool is not available”&lt;/strong&gt;. Let me start by saying this is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; an issue with the VCSA 6.5 ISO or installer, it has to do with a change in Sierra. Also, before I go any further, Sierra &lt;strong&gt;is currently not supported&lt;/strong&gt; with the VCSA 6.5 installer. Engineering is working to support Sierra in a future update. The supported system requirements for the VCSA installer are &lt;span style=&#34;color: #0000ff;&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://pubs.vmware.com/vsphere-65/index.jsp#com.vmware.vsphere.install.doc/GUID-BA4FA18C-1049-42AA-A5CD-DE863565251B.html#GUID-BA4FA18C-1049-42AA-A5CD-DE863565251B&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. With that said, I want to shed more light on why this is happening and what options are available with Sierra.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The vCenter Server Appliance (VCSA) 6.5 has significant new features and improvements mentioned &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://emadyounis.com/vcenter/vcenter-server-appliance-vcsa-6-5-whats-new-rundown/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. One area of notice is the installer, which in this release not only has a new look and feel but other improvements. These improvements are not only visible from the ISO, but also during the deployment. The end result is a better experience throughout the VCSA deployment process. Let’s jump in and take a closer look.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;During VMworld Barcelona 2016, VMware announced vSphere 6.5. With lots of new features and updates, this is one of the biggest vSphere releases we have had in a while. Leading the charge is none other than the vCenter Server Appliance (VCSA). VMware’s direction for vCenter Server is the VCSA and it’s quite evident from this release. The VCSA and its Windows counterpart remain on par when it comes to scalability. From an operational and feature perspective, the VCSA has advantages. This post is a quick rundown of the VCSA 6.5, I’ll go into more details in future blog posts. Time to take a look at what’s new and why migrate2vcsa you should 🙂&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I have been a fan of the vCenter Server Appliance (VCSA) since its release. With continuous improvements, it’s evident that VCSA is the future. My other favorite thing is &lt;span style=&#34;color: #0000ff;&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ravellosystems.com&#34;&gt;Ravello&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. They have given us the ability to have a home lab in the cloud, extend our current labs, and share blueprints. Two great products, that up to this point were not able to be used together. This is like having peanut butter on one slice and jelly on the other, and eating them individually.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

There were several sessions giving love to vCenter. This included the vCenter Server Appliance (VCSA). Here are a few of the sessions that are worth a look.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>vCenter Appliance (VCSA) 6.0 Scripted Install</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The VCSA 6.0 has two deployment types, guided and scripted. The scripted deployment is now simplified. You are now provided several templates, 5 to be exact. Now You don’t have to just use the default templates you can add to them or even create your own. Getting started is not that hard; once all the necessary information is available. The templates are usable from a command prompt or PowerShell. Let’s walk through how to use both.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Some features we’ve been waiting for a while now, others are new or revamped. It’s evident that VMware has put effort into the vCenter appliance. In previous releases it was lacking several features needed to make it equal to its Windows Counterpart. Well it seems that VMware has heard the many cries, and the appliance is now, in my opinion, ready for prime time. Let’s take a look at what’s new and you decide if you will be a vCenter 6.0 appliance adopter.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;To take advantage of the new features that vRA 6.2 has to offer, it’s time to upgrade. The upgrade will make it easier to transition from the vCAC branding to vRA. This was also a good time to start thinking about how to go about the process.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
