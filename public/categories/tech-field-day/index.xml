      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are two industry standards when it comes to duplication. The first type is Inline which occurs as data is being written. Second is Post-Process where data is analyzed after being written. So what’s the difference to using one over the other?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Their approach is private clouds should be simple without the worry of large IT staffs and ROI. Their solution is delivered onto your existing infrastructure using a SaaS managed approached to OpenStack. Of course; as you read this and think no way can a private cloud utilizing OpenStack be simple. Well tell that to the folks at Platform9, because they’re doing it. Here are 10 reasons to consider:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The stage is now set for January 14-16 &lt;a href=&#34;http://techfieldday.com/event/vfd4/&#34;&gt;Tech Field Day – Virtualization Field Day 4&lt;/a&gt;. I’m honored and pleased to announce that I’ve been invited to attend the event, which will take place in Austin, Texas. The Tech Field Day events allow IT vendors an opportunity to present on products and independent thought leaders to discuss and share opinions. Who makes up these independent thought leaders you ask? The selected delegates come from various independent backgrounds such as authors, bloggers, speakers and podcasters. The key word here is independent; in order for you to participate as a delegate you can’t currently work for a vendor. For more information about the delegates and selection process check out the following &lt;a href=&#34;http://techfieldday.com/delegates/become-field-day-delegate/&#34;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
